Topic :- 

This project domain is Airline Transportation. The Objective of this project is to perform Web Scraping on either of Kayak.com and expedia.com or both to predict flight prices. My target variable will be the price (continuous numeric value). 
I am planning to execute the Python Script every few hours, compare prices since the inception of executing the script and email me the results in frequency.
